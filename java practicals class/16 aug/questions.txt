Q1. Write a java program to Check Number Is Spy Number or Not.
Example :
A number is said to be a Spy number if the sum of all the digits is equal to the product of all digits.
     Input : 1412
     Output : Spy Number 

Explanation :
sum = (1 + 4 + 1 + 2) = 8
product = (1 * 4 * 1 * 2) = 8
since, sum == product == 8
 
Q2. Write a Java program that takes an alphabet character and toggles its case using ASCII values and operators.
·        Example: a → A, Z → z.
